# rest-WSD

This is Maven Java (1.7+) project, that (1) implements a WordNet-based WSD method and (2) implements calls to a number of remote (BabelFly) and locally installed (MetaMap) WSD systems, to disambiguate the SemRep clinical corpus. It also implements a method to align the UIDs of the word senses using linked data (and SPARQL/Jena).

It requires the manual installation of the UMLS Metathesuarus and the associated MetaMap clinical WSD system on a local computer.
