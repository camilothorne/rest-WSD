This term is in distinction with immovable property (or immoveable property) or immovables (or immoveables), such as land and buildings. Movable property on land, that which was not automatically sold with the land, included for example larger livestock (wildlife and smaller livestock like chickens, by contrast, was often sold as part of the land). In fact the word cattle is the Old Norman variant of Old French chatel (derived from Latin capitalis, \u201cof the head\u201d), which was once synonymous with general movable personal property.","id":24695,"title":"Personal property","start":203,"rho":"0.01695","end":211,"spot":"moveable"},{"abstract":"Bioaccumulation refers to the accumulation of substances, such as pesticides, or other organic chemicals in an organism. Bioaccumulation occurs when an organism absorbs a toxic substance at a rate greater than that at which the substance is lost. Thus, the longer the biological half-life of the substance the greater the risk of chronic poisoning, even if environmental levels of the toxin are not very high. Bioaccumulation, for example in fish, can be predicted by models. Biotransformation can strongly modify bioaccumulation of chemicals in an organism.","id":59503,"title":"Bioaccumulation","start":212,"rho":"0.05556","end":224,"spot":"accumulation"},{"abstract":"Debris is rubble, wreckage, ruins, litter and discarded garbage/refuse/trash, scattered remains of something destroyed, or, in geology, large rock fragments left by a melting glacier etc. The singular form of debris is debris.

It is one of the four traditional classes of tissues (the others being epithelial, muscle and nervous tissue). It is the most diverse tissue. Connective Tissue (CT) is found throughout the body. In fact the whole framework of the skeleton and the different specialized connective tissues from the crown of the head to the toes determine the form of the body and act as an entity. CT has 3 main components: cells, fibers, and extracellular matrix, all embedded in the body fluids. Fibroblasts are the cells responsible for the production of connective tissue. The interaction of the fibers, the extracellular matrix and the water, together, form the pliable connective tissue as a whole. Connective tissue makes up a variety of physical structures including tendons and the connective framework of fibers in muscles, capsules and ligaments around joints, cartilage, bone, adipose tissue, blood and lymphatic tissue. CT is classified into three subtypes; Embryonic CT, Proper CT, and Special CT. The Proper CT subtype includes dense regular CT, dense irregular CT, and loose CT. The Special CT subtype includes cartilage, bone, adipose tissue, blood, hematopoietic tissue (tissue that makes blood cells) and lymphatic tissue.","id":228845,"title":"Connective tissue","start":262,"rho":"0.16629","end":269,"spot":"fibrous"},{"abstract":"Adhesions are fibrous bands that form between tissues and organs, often as a result of injury during surgery.
